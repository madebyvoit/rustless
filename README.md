# Rust Learning Project with egui

Welcome to my Rust learning project! This repository is dedicated to helping me learn Rust and the [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) library by building a desktop application. The goal is to create a functional app with features like a text editor, a graph view, and potentially more in the future.

## Project Overview

This project is a hands-on way to explore Rust's ecosystem, focusing on GUI development using the `egui` library. `egui` is an immediate mode GUI library that is simple, fast, and portable, making it a great choice for learning and building desktop applications.

### Features

1. **Text Editor**: A basic text editor to create, edit, and save text files.
2. **Graph View**: A visual representation of data (e.g., nodes and edges) to explore graph algorithms or visualize relationships.
3. **Future Features**: Additional features like file management, settings, or integrations with other tools may be added as the project evolves.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your machine.
