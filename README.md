##Rust Learning Project with egui
Welcome to my Rust learning project! This repository is dedicated to helping me learn Rust and the egui library by building a desktop application. The goal is to create a functional app with features like a text editor, a graph view, and potentially more in the future.

###Project Overview
This project is a hands-on way to explore Rust's ecosystem, focusing on GUI development using the egui library. egui is an immediate mode GUI library that is simple, fast, and portable, making it a great choice for learning and building desktop applications.

###Planned Features
- Text Editor: A basic text editor to create, edit, and save text files.

- Graph View: A visual representation of data (e.g., nodes and edges) to explore graph algorithms or visualize relationships.

###Future Features: Additional features like file management, settings, or integrations with other tools may be added as the project evolves.

##Getting Started
###Prerequisites
Rust installed on your machine.

Basic familiarity with Rust and its ecosystem.

###Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-egui-learning-project.git
cd rust-egui-learning-project
Build the project:

bash
Copy
cargo build
Run the application:

bash
Copy
cargo run
Project Structure
src/: Contains the Rust source code.

main.rs: Entry point of the application.

editor.rs: Module for the text editor functionality.

graph_view.rs: Module for the graph visualization.

assets/: Stores any static files like icons or sample data.

Cargo.toml: Manages dependencies and project metadata.

Contributing
This project is primarily for my personal learning, but if you're interested in contributing, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Suggestions for improvements or new features are always welcome!

Roadmap
Set up the basic Rust project with egui.

Implement a simple text editor.

Add a graph view for visualizing data.

Add file management (open, save, export).

Implement additional features (TBD).
